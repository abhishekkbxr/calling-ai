## Sales Scripts

### 1. Software Solutions Sales Script

Hi [LEAD_NAME], this is Sarah from TechCorp Solutions. I hope I'm catching you at a good time.

I'm reaching out because we help companies like [COMPANY] streamline their operations and reduce costs by up to 30% through our automation platform.

I'd love to learn a bit about your current challenges with workflow management. Are you currently using any automation tools for your business processes?

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE]

Based on what you're telling me, it sounds like our platform could be a great fit. We've helped similar companies in your industry save significant time and money.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute demo next week to see how this could work for your specific situation?
```

### 2. Marketing Services Script

```
Hello [LEAD_NAME], this is Alex from Digital Growth Partners. How are you doing today?

I'm calling because I noticed [COMPANY] has a strong online presence, and I wanted to reach out about an opportunity that could help you generate even more qualified leads.

We specialize in helping businesses like yours increase their online visibility and drive more targeted traffic. Are you currently working with a digital marketing agency, or handling marketing in-house?

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE]

That's interesting. What I'd love to do is show you some case studies of companies similar to yours that have seen 40-60% increases in qualified leads within the first 3 months.

Would you have 20 minutes this week for a quick consultation where I can share some specific strategies that could work for [COMPANY]?
```

### 3. Financial Services Script

```
Hi [LEAD_NAME], this is Jennifer from Capital Growth Advisors. I hope you have a moment to chat.

I'm reaching out to business owners in your area because we've been helping companies secure funding and optimize their financial strategies during these challenging times.

Can I ask - are you currently looking at any expansion opportunities or considering additional funding for [COMPANY]?

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE]

That's exactly what we specialize in. We've helped businesses secure anywhere from $50K to $2M in funding, often with better terms than traditional banks.

I'd love to discuss your specific situation and see if we might be able to help. Would you be available for a brief call this week to explore your options?
```

## Follow-up Scripts

### 1. Warm Follow-up

```
Hi [LEAD_NAME], this is [AGENT_NAME] from [COMPANY]. We spoke last week about [PREVIOUS_TOPIC].

I wanted to follow up because I mentioned I'd send you that information about [SPECIFIC_TOPIC]. Did you have a chance to review it?

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE]

Great! Based on what we discussed, I think there are some specific ways we could help [LEAD_COMPANY]. Do you have a few minutes to discuss the next steps?
```

### 2. Re-engagement Script

```
Hi [LEAD_NAME], this is [AGENT_NAME] from [COMPANY]. I know it's been a while since we last spoke.

I'm reaching out because we've just launched some new features that directly address the challenges you mentioned about [SPECIFIC_PAIN_POINT].

I thought you might be interested in seeing how these updates could benefit [LEAD_COMPANY]. Would you have 10 minutes for a quick update call?
```

## Objection Handling Scripts

### 1. "Not Interested" Response

```
I completely understand, [LEAD_NAME]. I know you're busy running [COMPANY].

Can I ask - is it that the timing isn't right, or is it that this type of solution isn't a priority for you right now?

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE - If timing:] 
That makes sense. When would be a better time to revisit this? I'd be happy to reach out then.

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE - If not a priority:]
I understand. Can I ask what your biggest challenges are right now with [RELEVANT_AREA]?
```

### 2. "We're Happy with Current Solution"

```
That's great to hear that you're happy with your current setup, [LEAD_NAME]. 

Can I ask what you like most about your current solution? I'm always interested in learning what works well for businesses like yours.

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE]

That sounds like a solid approach. The reason I called is that we've been helping companies who thought they were happy with their current solution save an additional 20-30% in costs while getting better results.

Would you be open to a brief comparison just to see if there might be some additional opportunities? No pressure - just information.
```

### 3. "Send Me Information"

```
Absolutely, [LEAD_NAME]. I'd be happy to send you some information.

To make sure I send you the most relevant materials, can you tell me a bit about your current situation with [RELEVANT_TOPIC]?

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE]

Perfect. I'll send you a customized overview based on what you've told me. 

I find that a quick 10-minute call after you've reviewed the materials is really helpful to answer any questions. Would you prefer early morning or afternoon for a brief follow-up call?
```

## Closing Scripts

### 1. Demo Scheduling

```
Based on our conversation, [LEAD_NAME], it sounds like this could be a great fit for [COMPANY].

What I'd like to do is set up a brief 20-minute demo where I can show you exactly how this would work for your specific situation.

I have some time available Tuesday at 2 PM or Wednesday at 10 AM. Which would work better for you?
```

### 2. Information Gathering

```
[LEAD_NAME], I think there's definitely potential here for [COMPANY].

What I'd like to do is have one of our specialists put together a customized analysis for your situation. This would be complimentary, of course.

To do that effectively, I'd need about 15 minutes to understand your current setup better. Would you prefer to schedule that conversation for later this week or early next week?
```

### 3. Soft Close

```
[LEAD_NAME], I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.

From what you've shared, it sounds like [SPECIFIC_BENEFIT] could make a real difference for [COMPANY].

What would you say is the best next step from your perspective?
```

## Script Customization Tips

### Personalization Variables

- `[SPECIFIC_PAIN_POINT]` - Previously identified challenge
- `[RELEVANT_AREA]` - Industry-specific area of focus

### Best Practices

1. **Keep it conversational** - Scripts should sound natural, not robotic
2. **Include pause points** - Mark where to wait for responses
3. **Prepare for objections** - Have responses ready for common objections
4. **Personalize with data** - Use information from the lead's company
5. **Focus on benefits** - Emphasize value, not features
6. **Ask open-ended questions** - Encourage dialogue
7. **Have clear next steps** - Every call should end with a specific action

## Testing and Optimization

### A/B Testing Scripts

1. Create variations of your opening lines
